<h1>Carolina in the Pines</h1>
<p>May 01, 2016</p>
<p>
She came to me
<br>Said she knew me
<br>Said she'd known me a long time
<br>And she talked of being in love
<br>With every mountain she had climbed
</p>
<br>
<p>
  And she talked of trails she'd walked up
  <br>Far above the timberline
  <br>From that night on I knew I'd write songs
  <br>For Carolina in the pines.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  There's a full moon on the fourteenth
  <br>First quarter twenty-first
  <br>And a full moon in the last week
  <br>Brings a fullness to the earth.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  There's no guess work in the clockwork
<br>Of the world's heart or mine
<br>There are nights I only feel right
<br>With Carolina in the pines.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  As the frost grows on the windows
<br>The wood stove smokes and glows
<br>As the fire glows we can warm our souls
<br>Makin' rainbows in the coals.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  And we talk of trails we walk up
<br>Far above the timberline
<br>There are nights I only feel right
<br>With Carolina in the pines.
</p>
