<p>
'Hope' is the thing with feathers—
<br>That perches in the soul—
<br>And sings the tune without the words—
<br>And never stops—at all—</br>
</p>

<p>
And sweetest—in the Gale—is heard—
<br>And sore must be the storm—
<br>That could abash the little Bird
<br>That kept so many warm—
</p>

<p>
I've heard it in the chillest land—
<br>And on the strangest Sea—
<br>Yet, never, in Extremity,
<br>It asked a crumb—of Me.
</p>
